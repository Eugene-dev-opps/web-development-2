Design and function of the system:

What motivated me to write and design this system is the fact that we need projects that boost our nation 
and by that this system helps people to raise funds for their projects through donation.
This system solves the problem that causes ideas depletion meaning the ideas one has about a project are 
funded to full completion within the platform that i have come up with.This is made simple and easier than most 
peer to peer donation systems that inspired my project.I learned by consolting lectures and fellow programmers
which concludes that creating such a system is all about design and consulting the right fellows when stack.
What makes my project special is the idea that it has:
                                                       login, regustration, money transactions and proper design 
                                                       template features.
 This project can be ran through the local host through XAMPP app which is a must have to view the project.
 It contains user and admin modules which makes it a duable system.
 My design is illastrasted within the proposal and functions of each module that runs within the system.
